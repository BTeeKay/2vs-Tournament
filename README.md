# Capstone Project

Welcome to Ally, Brian, Iain & Ken's Codeclan Capstone group project.

## About

The App allows users to create a tournament based on a number of given players. Players can be saved to a database, or select a default player. Details of a player can be viewed i.e. Win/ Loss/ Played. Results of each round is tracked so players can progress on the tournament. 

## Instructions 

From the home page the user can go to the generate tournament page.
